# RateMyAir API

This repository contains the implementation of the **Rest APIs** for the project **RateMyAir**.  

It exposes the services to Insert to the database or provide to clients, the Air data collected by different sensors (more on that soon) to understand more about Air Quality where I live.  

Developed in **.NET Core 5** using the **Repository pattern**, are designed to be lightweight and efficient paying special attention in complying with Microsoft and HTTP standards. The security aspect is also important in order to be robust, understandable and easily consumable by any client. The goal is to run them on a low-performing hardware such as the Raspberry Pi 4.

#### Some of the solutions implemented in this project might not be the best but it is also developed as a teaching project.

## Specifications

* Database First approach
* Output in Json or Xml format
* Output pagination and filtering
* Global error handling
* ApiKey Authentication method for clients
* SQLite database
* Logging on file system
* Supports API versioning
* Swagger documentation
* Mapping entities to Data Transfer Objects using AutoMapper

## Database Scaffolding

The *Database First Approach* requires to create the tables in the database first, then creating the models in Visual Studio with the following procedure:

* In Visual Studio open Package Manager Console (Tools => Nuget Package Manager => Package Manager Console)
* In the "Default project" dropdown menu select "RateMyAir.Entities"
* Execute the following command:

```
Scaffold-DbContext "Data Source=<path to your sqlite database>" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite -OutputDir Models -force -context DatabaseContext
```

* Open "DatabaseContext.cs" class in "RateMyAir.Entities.Models" and delete the "OnConfiguring" method

## API Output

All the APIs use the following Json output structures depending on whether the response is paged or not:

#### Response

```
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "",
    "errors": [],
    "data": {
        
    }
}
```

#### Paged Response

```
{
    "pageNumber": 1,
    "pageSize": 5,
    "recordsTotal": 0,
    "success": true,
    "message": "",
    "errors": [],
    "data": []
}
```

#### HTTP Status Codes

I always try to use the best HTTP Status Code for every type of response. In this particular project the following are the possible response code:

* OK 200
* Unauthorized 401
* Forbidden 403
* BadRequest 400
* NotFound 404
* InternalServerError 500


## Air Quality Index

The Air Quality Index is based on concentration values of the following pollutants:

* Particulate Matter: PM 10 micrograms per cubic meter
* Fine Particulate Matter: PM 2.5 micrograms per cubic meter

| Pollutant  | Index level based on pollutant concentrations in Âµg/m3 |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|        | Good  | Fair  | Moderate | Poor | Very poor | Extremely poor |
| PM 2.5 | 0-10  | 10-20  | 20-25 | 25-50 | 50-75 | 75-800 |
| PM 10  | 0-20 | 20-40 | 40-50 | 50-100 | 100-150 | 150-1200 |

#### Details of the calculation algorithm

The API *api/airquality/index* returns the Air Quality Index of each day between the *DateFrom* and *DateTo* parameters based on the average pollution of the 24 hours. If no dates are provided returns the last 24 hours Air Quality Index.
